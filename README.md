Readme File 

ArtShareSoical - is a simple and friendly social platform for digital/ai artists and photographers to share their work on. They can sign in/sign up on the front loading page with a preview only of the Main Feed. It is not interactive on the sign-in other than being able to scroll. Once singed up for an account you can add art/photos and add captions/tags with your posts. You can also add a profile picture and Short Bio. You can like, reshare, and comment on other posts in the amin feed page. You can also see individuals posts by clicking on usernames above their posts which will take you to their profile and posts. You can explore on the explore page which is by filtering tags that have been used. You have an option to use a dark/light mode with a switch. However, the light mode is still a bit funky at the moment and I am still working on getting it fixed so I caution using it on light mode and will recommend using the dark mode for the time being. As I keep adding features/slowly I will update the readme file as needed. Have fun!
